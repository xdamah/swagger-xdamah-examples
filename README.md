# Swagger XDamah Examples #

This README documents whatever steps are necessary to get these example applications up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository  demonstrates capabilities of  Swagger Xadamah - https://github.com/xdamah/swagger-xdamah

## Prerequisites ##
Below are the prerequisites I would recommend before getting into this
### General Prerequisites ###
* Knowledge of Spring Boot
* Knowledge and experience of Swagger - Code First and Design First


### Technical Prerequisites ###

* Java 17
* Maven latest

### Main Concept ###

Swagger can be used with two approaches.
* Code First
* Design First  

Often in code first we write code of this type.
![Code First example](imgs/codefirsteg.png)
Then we generate swagger documents from this code.  

Not showing here the validation constraints and other best practices like Controller Advice usage for exception handling.  

Similarly in design first we write  swagger specifications similar to the below   
![Design First example](imgs/designfirsteg.png)

Then we generate code from the specifications.

Again not showing here details of validation constraints.

Will see more details in that regard later.   
If we look carefully - we will see that the swagger specifications- hand written or generated or for that matter the controller code hand written or generated are the API contract. They both specify the same things - 
* the url path.
* the validation constraints
* the media types for the request and response

It will not be incorrect to say that they both are request/response rules for request/response processing expressed in json/yaml or code.  

The main goal is to express, enforce those rules and invoke the business logic.

If we see the code each controller code will look very similar to another controller code. The main difference will be in the service method invoked.  

What we are trying to avoid here is generating or handwriting the controller and related code. The rules for that purpose including that of validations are already there in the swagger specs in json/yaml. 

Instead of generating/handwriting the controller code which mirrors the rules specified in the swagger specs is it possible to invoke apply those same rules leveraging whats specified in the swagger specs as source of truth for the rules and also achieve invoking of the service class method?  

The only code that is generated/written is that of the model POJO classes. We possibly will create the model classes when  we write the business logic in service classes.  
For this purpose we can choose one of the following:
1. To either write the model classes by hand along with the business service classes  
2. Or we can generate the model classes from the swagger specs. Use them in the servic classes.  

If we choose 1. we can even go for generating the corresponding swagger component schema specifications from the model classes

So that's the objective- Have less code. Rather just have swagger specifications + only that code which is not already expressed in the swagger specifications.   

What we have here is a variation of design first approach.
Design first usually implies code generation. Not so in our approach- Lets call it xdamah. X stands for Swagger extensions. Damah means self control. It's a word play implying that The swagger specs itself does the control without a need for coding or code-generating a controller.


### How do I get set up? ###


*Steps*  
* Run "git clone -b main https://github.com/xdamah/swagger-xdamah-examples.git"
* In the project folder run "mvn clean package".
* That should build all the example projects.
* Each project builds into a jar file - target/demo.jar   
* In each project cd [example project name]
* for example cd 1-first-example
* then run from comamnd prompt "java -jar target/demo.jar"
* When that finishes launching we should run http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html  
* Will be able to follow along using swagger ui.   
* Where needed will also refer to [postman collection](swagger-xdamah-postman-collection.json)  for same.  Do import the postman collection and try where needed.  (The postman collection- Might be getting a bit out of synch as f now) 
* More details in each project folder's Readme.MD.

### Whats in the examples? ###

The examples are organized into two folders   
* main-examples
* more-examples

Will discuss the main examples here first and understand what that is about.

If interested can go into more-examples folder later to understand what otehr feetures are also there.
