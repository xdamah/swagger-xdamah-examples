# 05-first-alt-example Demo #

Quite similar to 01-first-example  and 02-first-codegen-example.   
  
The difference is we dont generate the model classes.  
We write the model classes with the service API.

We dont duplicate the model class definition in the swagger component schema specification.

See pom.xml, "x-damah-models" in api-docs.json of this example for more on how this is configured.
